# The Effectiveness of ChatGPT in Log Parsing?
In our study, we used ChatGPT for log parsing tasks to measure how effectively it can parse logs. Also, we compared ChatGPT in a zero-shot scenario with Drain, and AEL in terms of the GA, MLA, and ED. We have also added a brief summary of the results that we got. In this study, we are answering the following two Research Questions.

## RQ1 - Can ChatGPT effectively perform log parsing?
RQ1 will clarify whether ChatGPT can successfully perform log parsing and also check its effectiveness by comparing it with state-of-the-art log parsing models such as Drain and AEL.
## RQ2 - How does ChatGPTâ€™s performance vary with different prompting methods?
